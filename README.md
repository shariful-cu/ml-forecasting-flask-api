# ML Forcasting Flask APIs
### Overview

This Flask application provides the endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/sklearn) that can predict the number of calls expected based on the previous weekâ€™s calls and the weather forecast for the given day. An example of input data is (in json format):
```agsl
input_data = {
        "max_wind": 7.0,
        "min_temp": 65.62399999999985,
        "max_temp": 90.65959999999984,
        "weather": "sky is clear",
        "prev_week": 3587.0,
        "day_of_week": 6.0
    }
```

NB: I used [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for automatically testing its functionalities. See the another README file in ./tests/ 

## Installation Instructions
First download and open this submitted project named as 'nyc311-forecasting-api' using your convenient IDE (intelliJ, pycharm, etc.)

Create a new virtual environment (python 3.8):
```sh
$ cd nyc311-forecasting-api
$ python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
Install the python packages specified in requirements.txt:
```sh
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Download and upload the trained model in ./data/ directory
[trained sklearn model](https://acceleratorlake.blob.core.windows.net/code/311_pipeline.pkl)


### Run Application
Hit this command that will run the development server to serve the application at `host='127.0.0.1, port=5000`
```sh
(venv) $ python3 run.py
```
The server will be up on [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Testing

To run all the tests (see more detail instructions in README file located in `../tests/`:

```sh
(venv) $ python -m pytest -v
```

## EXAMPLE 
(first run the app then, test it using `curl` command)

REQUEST (POST)
```sh
$ curl -d '{"max_wind":7.0, "min_temp":65.62399999999985, "max_temp": 90.65959999999984, "weather": "sky is clear", "prev_week": 3587.0, "day_of_week": 6.0}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/sklearn
```
RESPONSE (JSON):
```sh
{
  "forecast_date": "2023-07-08",
  "num_calls_forecasted": 3648,
  "num_staff_forecasted": 9
}
```

## WORKFLOWS
After hitting the run script (`run.py`):

1. App will be initialized by loading the trained sklearn model.
2. After initialization, it will run the producer and consumer in two different python threads.
3. Producer - refresh the current ML MODEL if a new version is uploaded in './data/'.
4. Consumer - always serve the latest ML MODEL.
5. Then, the Flask app will be started with a separate python thread.
6. App is now ready for handling your HTTP requests to predict the target forecasted number of calls and staff.
